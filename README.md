# Unity-Testing
Trying out Unity Engine. Scripting is coded in C#. Fundamentally, what I've learned is game development deals with a lot of object oriented programming. There isn't
too much logic or a necessity to understand hardcore algorithms for the most efficient way of blah blah blah. Rather, game development deals with the basic principle
that everything is composed of game objects and scripting brings about relations.
